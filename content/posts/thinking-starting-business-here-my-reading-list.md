Every now and then I meet someone who has made the decision to become their own boss.

When I do, I pull out this list of bookmarks and email it to them. I tell them to review the content in the order of the links and to avoid jumping ahead if they can.

<!--more-->

Without exception, I have been given extremely positive feedback. It is not that the list is *"The Only List You'll Ever Need To Start A Business!"*. Far from it.

It is because the resources are really useful, inspirational and challenging.

Maybe not all at the same time, and maybe not all of these things to all people. But for someone starting a business who is at the early stages of planning, something within the content resonates with them and helps them to refine their ideas.

I recently revisited the list as part of my research for [Jepto](http://www.jepto.com/) and I thought it needed to be given a better home than sitting in my bookmark bar.

So here it is. Review the content in the order of the links and avoid jumping ahead if you can.

1\. Seth Goddin: Startup School
-------------------------------

I didn't know who Seth Goddin was 12 months ago until a colleague shared a link to his Startup School podcasts.

You would be forgiven for thinking that the content is aimed at the tech sector "disruptors", but he covers a wide range of topics that are 100% relevant to traditional, brick-and-mortar businesses too.  

-   Podcast: Start with the [first podcast](https://art19.com/shows/startup-school/episodes/39074f42-e391-40dd-9692-9bcf676d4538) then listen to the [rest in order](https://art19.com/shows/startup-school?perPage=25) (also on iTunes and Stitcher)

2\. One page business plan
--------------------------

I was involved in a workshop for not-for-profit organisations who were struggling to keep going with very limited resources.

These volunteers don't have time or experience to complete a 10 page business plan.

They still need to define what they are trying to achieve (for funding applications, resourcing planning etc), so we had to find a way for them to summarise what their organisation does on one page.  

I found a one page business plan that hit the spot. Simple, yet detailed enough to really give direction to the people running and working in the organisation. I realised that most business can start with a one page plan. It is good enough for early stages and can be built on later.

3\. Moz Product Launch Checklist
--------------------------------

Moz and [Rand Fishkin](https://sparktoro.com/blog/) have been around for a long time (since 2004!). Rand's "[Whiteboard Friday](https://moz.com/blog/category/whiteboard-friday)" episodes were a must watch for anyone interested in launch a website or marketing their business online, until he departed Moz in 2018.

The Product Launch Checklist is a great video that really hits home on some key points. Yes it is "digital" in nature, but the concepts can easily be applied to anyone setting up a more traditional company.

4\. Effective Inbound Marketing with Marcus Sheridan
----------------------------------------------------

OK, so inbound marketing is really an online/digital area of expertise. What makes this interesting is how Marcus used these ideas to save his swimming pool business from going under in 2008.

5\. Ten lessons from 1,000 days of marketing a startup
------------------------------------------------------

This one is heavily focused on the online world and content marketing. Combined with Marcus Sheridan's podcast above this article can help form a very clear plan for any businesses online content.

6\. List of 68 Types to Advertising
------------------------------------

To balance things off, here is a list of 68 different types of advertising available to a business.

This list is just a reminder that there are many ways to get in front of your audience; for example flyers, sponsorship, events and radio. After all, is not all about digital, social media and online advertising.

7\. I'm still researching...
---------------------

Jepto is a very early stage business and I am always looking for ideas. If you have any useful or inspirational content, please share it.

I'll create and share an updated list with any resources that are added to the comments.
